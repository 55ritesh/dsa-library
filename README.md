# DSA Library

DSA Library is a beginner-friendly repository that contains all the major Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in 5 different languages. Through this repository we aim to create a centralized DSA resource which we may look up to for revision before tech interviews.

Note: <i>This repository is created with the sole intent of guiding beginners to their initial Open Source contributions.</i>
