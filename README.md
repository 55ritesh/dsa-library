# DSA Library

DSA Library is a beginner-friendly repository that contains all the major Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in 5 different languages. Through this repository we aim to create a centralized DSA resource which we may look up to for revision before tech interviews.

Note: <i>This repository is created with the sole intent of guiding beginners to their initial Open Source contributions.</i>
## What to contribute?
Dsa-library is a culmination of all major Data Structures and Algorithms.You can contribute to the data stucture of your choice, it's implementation in either of C,C++,JAVA,PYHTON,JAVASCRIPT.
Apart from that, you can check the Algorithms section and add the algorithm of your choice implement it in any of the above mentioned 5 languages. 
## How to Contribute?
- `Fork` the repository
- If you want to add implementation of a Data Structure go inside that folder and click `Create new file`
- File name convention: DataStructure_languagename.extension
- Add the complete implementation of the data structure and `commit` the changes
- `Fetch Upstream` & if there are no merge conflicts ,click on Contribute
- Create `Pull Request` following proper convention
- That's it, Thank You for contributing to DSA Library

We appreciate all kinds of contributions from core-code contributions to non-code contributions like writing a blog, suggesting a feature, etc.
